# Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) with Carbon, Silicon, Nitrogen Ecosystem (CoSiNE) model

This is a modified version of ROMS. This version added the Carbon, Silicon, Nitrogen Ecosystem (CoSiNE) model developed by Chai et al. as an ecological (biological) module of ROMS. The added code references the [kshedstrom / roms](https://github.com/kshedstrom/roms) developed by kate.
